<p>Scoring 90+ in Class 9 Maths is not about being naturally gifted. It is about building strong fundamentals, practicing regularly, and using the right exam strategy. Many students lose marks not because they do not understand concepts, but because they lack structured preparation.</p>

<h2>1. Build Strong Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Class 9 introduces important topics like Number Systems, Polynomials, Linear Equations, and Geometry. These concepts form the foundation for Class 10 and beyond.</p>

<div class="highlight">
Focus on understanding "why" a formula works, not just memorizing it.
</div>

<h2>2. Practice Daily (Minimum 5 Questions Per Topic)</h2>
<p>Mathematics is a practice-based subject. Solve questions daily. Start with NCERT examples, then move to exercise questions, and finally try additional practice problems.</p>

<h2>3. Master Algebra and Linear Equations</h2>
<p>Algebra carries significant weight in exams. Students must be comfortable solving equations, simplifying expressions, and handling word problems.</p>

<h2>4. Revise Formulas Weekly</h2>
<p>Keep a separate formula notebook. Revise formulas every Sunday. Consistent revision improves speed and accuracy during exams.</p>

<h2>5. Solve Previous Year Questions</h2>
<p>Practicing previous papers helps students understand the exam pattern and frequently asked question types.</p>

<h2>6. Improve Presentation Skills</h2>
<p>Write steps clearly. Avoid skipping steps. Show all calculations neatly. Presentation can impact scoring in subjective questions.</p>

<h2>7. Attempt Weekly Tests</h2>
<p>Mock tests help identify weak areas. Time-bound practice increases exam confidence.</p>

<div class="highlight">
Consistency + Concept Clarity + Practice = 90+ Marks
</div>

<h2>Final Advice</h2>
<p>Students who stay regular, clear their doubts immediately, and practice consistently can easily score above 90 in Class 9 Maths.</p>
